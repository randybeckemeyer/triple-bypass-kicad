The schematic circuits are the same as db-electronics version 0.3. The schematic and layout are redrawn with as many built-in library parts as possible. The schematic is shuffled around but contains equivelant circuits with jumpers added. The board is larger than db-electronics version 0.3 and is untested.

# Install Instructions
Use the Mega Amp 2.0 thread for wire tap points on various console revisions.

# Uses Solder Jumpers instead of different Bill of Materials
This is intended to be built with a pick and place assemble line. No need for resistor kits or boards with different build options. The board is designed to be fully populated with one BOM. There are solder jumpers for attenuation resistors and to choose which sound chip your system contains.
